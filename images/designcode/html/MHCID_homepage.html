					<span id="name-header"> Master of Human-Computer Interaction + Design </span>
				</h1>
				<p> A truly interdisciplinary experience with world-class faculty and students from four 
					departments in the cross-disciplinary group, DUB: Design-Use-Build:
					<ul id="cross-discipline">
						<li>Computer Science &amp; Engineering</li>
						<li>Design</li>
						<li>Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering</li>
						<li>The Information School</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p> By integrating several disciplines, this unique Master of Human-Computer Interaction and 
					Design program brings together design, technology, and the study of human behavior, creating 
					students who can work seamlessly across these fields to create innovative new products, 
					technologies and services.
				</p>
				<p> In a year-long, project-based curriculum, students learn the latest tools and techniques in 
					user experience and interface design, prototyping, user research and evaluation. The Master 
					of Human-Computer Interaction and Design courses consist of both hands-on studios (often 
					focused on industry-sponsored projects) as well as cutting-edge lecture courses. The 
					combination of theory and practice, with emphasis on making and doing, provides a dynamic and 
					intensive learning experience.
